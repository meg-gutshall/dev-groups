## Post Meetup Notes

Thank you everyone for attending. I will follow up with the event recording in the next few days. In the meantime, here is the text form of the post presentation cheat sheet:

Arrays Insert: O\(n\) Get: O\(1\) Delete: O\(n\) Search: O\(n\) Ordered elements index-based structure often contiguous in memory; fixed length

Lists Insert: O\(n\) Get: O\(n\) Delete: O\(n\) Search: O\(n\) Linear collection data not adjacent in memory connected by references either single to next or double to previous and next \(more space\). Sentinel, dummy, or null at start and end. Sequential access. Easy to rearrange. Circular. Node or element.
