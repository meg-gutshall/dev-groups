## Post Meetup Notes

Hello Coders! Our wonderful presenter Daniella will be discussing some coding problems during the event next week. Here are the problems if you'd like to give them a try:  
  
Invert Binary Tree - [https://leetcode.com/problems/invert-binary-tree/](https://leetcode.com/problems/invert-binary-tree/)  
Kth Smallest Element in a BST - [https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-smallest-element-in-a-bst/](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-smallest-element-in-a-bst/)  
Construct Binary Tree from Inorder and Postorder Traversal - [https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-binary-tree-from-inorder-and-postorder-traversal/](https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-binary-tree-from-inorder-and-postorder-traversal/)  
  
We will try to get to all the problems - if not, we'll go through in order.
