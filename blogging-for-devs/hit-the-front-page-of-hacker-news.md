## Part I



## Part II

### Plan B

* Post to Reddit
  * Search subreddits
* Google Search
  * Use Google Keyword Planner
* Conferences
  * Turn a blog post into a talk!
* Related sites
  * As in sites related to the content of your blog post
* Niche forums
* Other sites
  * Indie Hackers
  * Product Hunt
  * Facebook groups
  * LinkedIn

### Elevate Your Writing

**MY SECRET WEAPON:** Investing more into quality writing

* Spend more time editing
* Tell it like a story
  * Has a beginning, middle, and end
  * Use emotions in the story to engage the reader
  * Make sure to still include substance with a lesson and/or thought process
* Write in your own voice
  * Show your personality through your writing
  * Make it distinctive
  * _**This is not easy!!**_
* Avoid "formalizing" your writing
  * Use simple words, you're not writing a resume
* Have a hook \(i.e. hook the reader in!\)
  * This is the most common mistake
  * Readers don't have infinite patience
  * A good hook offers something valuable to the reader like:
    * A technique that helps them professionally
    * An idea that intrigues them
    * A useful service
* Avoid the wall of text
  * Stock photos are better than nothing but worse than everything else
* Take creative liberties
  * Simplify complicated stories
  * Omit unnecessary details
  * Condense but don't add
* **EDIT RIGOROUSLY**
  * Re-read your articles
  * Read them out loud
* Work with an editor
* Work with an illustrator

#### Common Mistakes

* Overly narrow audience
  * Using jargon, abbreviation, or insider terms
* Extraneous content
* Grammatical errors/typos
