## Projects

### DiaperBase/PartnerBase

* Provide diapers \(children's and adults'\) and period supplies free of charge
  * Not covered by WIC
* Reaches 2 million children and 50,000 women

#### Goals

* **Usability**: Think Steven Krug's book _Don't Make Me Think_
* **Inclusive Language**: Since the Alliance for Period Supplies \(the national organization in charge of period supply organizations\) is recommending our software we want to start updating/changing the language to make it inclusive
* **Composite Items**: Right now partners can only request single types of items \(size 1 diapers, size 2 diapers, etc.\). We are going to create the ability for banks to create "kits" that they assemble.
  * For example: A first time period kit with wipes, pads, and tampons in it.
* We also are looking for someone to spike out and test some Rails 6 multiple database functionality to link the apps better and make us less reliant on API calls.
* Lots, lots more
