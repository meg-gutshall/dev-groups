## Method of the Month: `.map`

Presented by Caroline

* Works on arrays, hashes, and ranges
* `.map` won't change the underlying data structure. It will return a new one.
  * `.map!` will change the underlying structure and return it.
* `.collection` is the exact same thing as `.map`.
* When querying the database in Rails, it's more efficient to use `.pluck` instead of `.map`.
