# How to Be an Antiracist by Ibram X. Kendi

## My Notes & Highlights

### Introduction: My Racist Introduction

> Classic Dad. He couldn't care less what judgmental White people thought about him. He rarely if ever put on a happy mask, faked a calmer voice, hid his opinion, or avoided making a scene. I loved and hated my father for living on his own terms in a world that usually denies Black people their own terms. \(p. 4\)

Good for dad!

> Of course, intelligence is as subjective as beauty. But I kept using "objective" standards, like test scores and report cards, to judge myself. \(p. 4\)

Heard that!

> Did anyone notice the irony that at this Martin Luther King Jr. oratorical contest, my free Black life represented Stonewall Jackson High School? \(p. 5\)

> Racist ideas make people of color think less of themselves, which makes them more vulnerable to racist ideas. Racist ideas make White people think more of themselves, which further attracts them to racist ideas.
>
> I thought I was a subpar student and was bombarded by messages—from Black people, White people, the media—that told me that the reason was rooted in my race...which made me more discouraged and less motivated as a student...which only further reinforced for me the racist idea that Black people just weren't very studious...which made me feel even more despair or indifference...and on it went. At no point was this cycle interrupted by a deeper analysis of my own specific circumstances and shortcomings or a critical look at the ideas of the society that judged me—instead, the cycle hardened the racist ideas inside me until I was ready to preach them to others. \(p. 6\)

I can definitely see how this would happen. Society creates vicious cycles and institutionalized racism is one of the most vicious of them all. Women know this all too well when it comes to sexism. I know I dealt with this in middle school and high school as I became more cognizant of the world around me and the boys in my class became horny little monsters.

What I want to know about Ibram is:

1. Where were his teachers? He was obviously a bright young man if he made it that far in the oratorical contest. Why did they not intervene or advocate on his behalf to help his grades improve? Why didn't they take an interest in this bright student that couldn't connect with the curriculum?
2. Where were his parents? He just told us how his father doesn't care what judgmental white people think about him. Did he not instill this same confidence in his son?

From the outside looking in, it seems like this reflection on his thoughts in high school leave out a very important factor: adolescence. The teenage years are very formative as you're creating your own identity and figuring out the world around you. You discover that adults don't know everything and not necessarily everything you've been taught is true—in fact, a good part of it isn't. You learn to be wary of authority figures and take everything with a grain of salt. You become less naive. You grow up.

I think this needs to be considered as well as the racist ideas that were pressed upon him.

> And I was calling Black youth "they"? Who on earth did I think I was? \(p. 7\)

I've caught myself doing this when writing about white people. It's a bad habit to get into and I have to be more careful about it.

It's easy to do when you're discussing specific racist behavior of white people which you are trying to stop. You want to separate yourself from them because of the disgusting offensiveness of it all.

> I didn't realize that to say something is wrong about a racial group is to say something is inferior about that racial group. I did not realize that to say something is inferior about a racial group is to say a racist idea. \(p. 7\)

> Internalized racism is the real Black on Black crime. \(p. 8\)

That's a **very powerful** statement.

> This is the consistent function of racist ideas—and of any kind of bigotry more broadly: to manipulate us into seeing people as the problem, instead of the policies that ensnare them. \(p. 8\)

> Denial is the heartbeat of racism, beating across ideologies, races, and nations. It is beating within us. \(p. 9\)

> But there is no neutrality in the racism struggle. The opposite of "racist" isn't "not racist." It is "antiracist." What's the difference? One endorses the idea of a racial hierarchy as a racist, or a racial equality as an antiracist. One either believes problems are rooted in groups of people, as a racist, or locates the roots of problems in power and policies, as an antiracist. One either allows racial inequities to persevere, as a racist, or confronts racial inequities, as an antiracist. There is no in-between safe space of "not racist." The claim of "not racist" neutrality is a mask for racism. \(p. 9\)

> It is descriptive, and the only way to undo racism is to consistently identify and describe it—and then dismantle it. The attempt to turn the usefully descriptive term into an almost unusable slur is, of course, designed to do the opposite: to freeze us into inaction. \(p. 9\)

> The common idea of claiming "color blindness" is akin to the notion of being "not racist"—as with the "not racist," the colorblind individual, by ostensibly failing to see race, fails to see racism and falls into racist passivity. The language of color blindness—like the language of "not racist"—is a mask to hide racism. \(p. 10\)

> The good news is that racist and antiracist are not fixed identities. We can be a racist one minute and an antiracist the next. What we say about race, what we do about race, in each moment, determines what—not who—we are. \(p. 10\)

> This book is ultimately about the basic struggle we're all in, the struggle to be fully human and to see that others are fully human. \(p. 11\)

### **Chapter 1:** Definitions

> **RACIST:** One who is supporting a racist policy through their actions or inaction or expressing a racist idea. \(p. 13\)

It's interesting that he includes inaction in his definition of racist. Also, is he defining an adjective or a noun? Definitions are supposed to include that information and it would be helpful to have it here.

> "The evangelical church...supported the status quo. It supported slavery; it supported segregation; it preached against any attempt the Black man made to stand up on his own two feet." \(—Tom Skinner, p. 15\)

> "Any gospel that does not...speak to the issue of enslavement" and "injustice" and "inequality—any gospel that does not want to go where people are hungry and poverty-stricken and set them free in the name of Jesus Christ—is not the gospel." \(—Tom Skinner, p. 15\)

> They were saved into Black liberation theology and joined the churchless church of the Black Power movement. \(p. 16\)
