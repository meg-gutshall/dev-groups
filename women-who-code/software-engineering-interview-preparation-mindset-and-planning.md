# Software Engineering Interview Preparation: Mindset and Planning

**Geeta Chaudhry**

## Abstract

If you are wondering how to structure your preparation so you can stand your ground against the ever growing avalanche of leetcode problems, you might find this chat with Geeta interesting. Bring your questions!

## Questions

1. How do you handle a rude interviewer?
   1. Be full of yourself! Don't let it shake who you are. You cannot change their behavior, you can only bring your energy.

### Tangents

## Notes

* Tech interview preparation is the most requested presentation topic
* There's an avalanche of practice problems as well as an avalanche of advice out there but it's way overwhelming!
* Be compassionate and understanding with yourself during this time!

### First Avalanche: Too many practice problems

No matter how many problems you do, will you ever be _ready_?

#### What does it mean to "do" a problem?

1. You grazed over a problem. You looked at it and didn't understand it.
2. You understood a problem. You solved it and passed the test cases.
3. You assimilated the problem. You learned the problem the first time, finished it, and moved it. You pick it up again a week later and approach it like it was your first time seeing it. You'll still make mistakes! Keep doing this until you **know** the problem.

> **Assimilating = Overlearning:** Assimilating is like a child learning to tie their shoes or button up their shirt. It's like isolating your code fluency muscles and lifting weights with them.

**Start with a small set of problems.** Pick 8â€“10 topics and choose a medium/hard problem from each topic. Assimilate these problems and then _**add**_ different problems and/or topics. This helps to train your brain for context switching as well!

Stick to one language to practice for your coding interviews.

### Second Avalanche: Too much advice

* When we hear success stories, it feels like the world is saying, "This is what worthy and esteemed engineers do" but we don't know the rest of  their life. Their path could be completely different.
  * This alienates us _**from ourselves**_.
  * Hearing about an inspiring story every five minutes can beat you down because you're not that person in the story.

> Be full of yourself!

If you're not full of yourself, what would you be full of? Society's expectations? Someone you're not?
